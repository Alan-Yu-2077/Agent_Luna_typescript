# Agent_Luna (TypeScript) — Development History

Last updated: 2026-06-11 (Asia/Shanghai) — v0.1.0 (Bun skeleton + WS server)

## Scope

Per-version log of what has actually shipped in the TypeScript rewrite. This is the **truth source**
for "what version are we on" — not the roadmap, not in-flight conversation.

Conventions match Python Luna:
- `Fact` = grounded in commit history, repository docs, or checked-in code in this TS repo.
- `Inference` = phase summary derived from those materials.
- `-dev` = current working-tree iteration not yet committed.

The Python original (`/Users/alanyu2077/Desktop/Agent_Luna`) stays the running production system
during the rewrite. Its version log is unrelated to this one — `v0.1` here is not `v0.1` there.

## Source material

- 2026-06-11 15-dimension ground-truth audit of Python Luna v0.47.9 (`/Users/alanyu2077/.claude/.../tasks/w7tdhaip0.output`)
- Design conversation 2026-06-11 (Bun / WS / SQLite / Zod / single-user / interleaved tool streaming)
- 减负 list (see [`../REWRITE_CONTEXT.md`](../REWRITE_CONTEXT.md))

## High-level stages (planned, subject to roadmap)

- `v0.1` — project skeleton: Bun + TS + Zod + bun:sqlite + WS server bootstrap. No agent logic yet.
- `v0.2` — tool spec: typed registry, `Result<T>`, streaming tool execution, 3 representative tools end-to-end (`time_now`, `read_file`, `remember`).
- `v0.3` — single-turn LLM round trip with Anthropic interleaved tool-use SSE wired through WS to a minimal client.
- `v0.4` — memory substrate on SQLite (L1 session state first).
- `v0.5+` — TBD; see roadmap.

## Detailed records

### `v0.1.0` — 2026-06-11 — Bun skeleton + WS server

Status:

- working tree (commit hash filled in after merge to main)

Fact:

- Created Bun monorepo root with `package.json` (workspaces `packages/*`), `tsconfig.base.json`
  (`strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `noUnusedLocals` + `noUnusedParameters`,
  `noEmit: true`, `types: ["bun"]`), `bunfig.toml` (`[install] saveTextLockfile = true`),
  `.gitignore` (commits `bun.lock`, ignores `bun.lockb`), `.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc`
  (semi, single-quote, trailing-comma all, width 100), `.prettierignore`.
- Added `packages/protocol/` (6 files, 86 lines): Zod `ClientEvent` (discriminated union of
  `PingEvent`) and `ServerEvent` (discriminated union of `PongEvent` + `ErrorEvent`) in
  `src/events.ts`; `assertNever` helper in `src/utils.ts`; `src/index.ts` re-exports.
  Dependency: `zod ^3.25.0`.
- Added `packages/server/` (6 files, 144 lines): `src/main.ts` boots `Bun.serve` on
  `LUNA_PORT` (default 8787) with WS upgrade; `src/ws.ts` handles open/message/close with
  Zod `safeParse` + exhaustive switch + `assertNever(event.type)`; `src/outbound.ts`
  centralizes `ServerEvent.parse` → `ws.send` as the **sole** validated outbound boundary;
  workspace dep `@luna/protocol: workspace:*`.
- Added test suites: `packages/protocol/src/events.test.ts` (8 tests, ClientEvent +
  ServerEvent parse/reject cases) and `packages/server/src/ws.test.ts` (4 tests, random-port
  WS round-trip, malformed JSON, unknown event, invalid seq). 12/12 green in 13ms.
- Installed dev tooling: `@types/bun`, `prettier`, `typescript`. Bun 1.3.14 (≥ 1.2 spec).
  Text-format `bun.lock` committed; binary `bun.lockb` ignored.
- Manual smoke against `bun run dev:server`: ping `seq:7` → pong with matching seq + valid
  `server_time_ms`; round-trip 3ms on localhost.
- TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` clean on both packages; no `as any`, no `as unknown`, no
  `@ts-ignore`, no `startswith('Error')` heuristic.

Inference:

- Establishes the **discriminated-union wire contract** that v0.2 (`tool.started` /
  `tool.progress` / `tool.finished`) and v0.3 (`turn.started` / `reply.token` /
  `turn.result` / `chat.send`) extend by appending variants — no protocol rewrite needed
  downstream. The `assertNever(event.type)` exhaustiveness pattern in `ws.ts` will catch any
  forgotten case at compile time when new variants land.
- Proves the locked runtime/wire choices (Bun + Zod + native WebSocket, single channel per
  session) work end-to-end with sub-100ms cold boot and 3ms ping/pong round-trip on
  localhost. The Python `time.sleep`-paced HTTP-thread serialization is structurally
  impossible in this stack.
- The `outbound()` validate-before-send wrapper is load-bearing for v0.2/v0.3: the tool
  dispatcher and the turn loop will each be handed an `emit: (e: ServerEvent) => void`
  callback that wraps `outbound`, so the wire boundary stays the **only** place schema
  validation lives. Eliminates the Python "frontend handler early-returns on a frame the
  backend assumes is consumed" silent-drift class of bugs by design.
- Confirms file-split: only **types and wire shapes** live in `packages/protocol`;
  `defineTool`, the dispatcher, and provider logic stay in `packages/server`. Frontend
  (`packages/web`) will consume the same protocol package in Initiative 6, getting
  contract drift as a type error rather than a runtime mismatch.
