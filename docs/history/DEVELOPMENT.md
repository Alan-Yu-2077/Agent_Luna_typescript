# Agent_Luna (TypeScript) — Development History

Last updated: 2026-06-11 (Asia/Shanghai) — pre-v0.1.0 (scaffolding only, no runtime code yet)

## Scope

Per-version log of what has actually shipped in the TypeScript rewrite. This is the **truth source**
for "what version are we on" — not the roadmap, not in-flight conversation.

Conventions match Python Luna:
- `Fact` = grounded in commit history, repository docs, or checked-in code in this TS repo.
- `Inference` = phase summary derived from those materials.
- `-dev` = current working-tree iteration not yet committed.

The Python original (`/Users/alanyu2077/Desktop/Agent_Luna`) stays the running production system
during the rewrite. Its version log is unrelated to this one — `v0.1` here is not `v0.1` there.

## Source material

- 2026-06-11 15-dimension ground-truth audit of Python Luna v0.47.9 (`/Users/alanyu2077/.claude/.../tasks/w7tdhaip0.output`)
- Design conversation 2026-06-11 (Bun / WS / SQLite / Zod / single-user / interleaved tool streaming)
- 减负 list (see [`../REWRITE_CONTEXT.md`](../REWRITE_CONTEXT.md))

## High-level stages (planned, subject to roadmap)

- `v0.1` — project skeleton: Bun + TS + Zod + bun:sqlite + WS server bootstrap. No agent logic yet.
- `v0.2` — tool spec: typed registry, `Result<T>`, streaming tool execution, 3 representative tools end-to-end (`time_now`, `read_file`, `remember`).
- `v0.3` — single-turn LLM round trip with Anthropic interleaved tool-use SSE wired through WS to a minimal client.
- `v0.4` — memory substrate on SQLite (L1 session state first).
- `v0.5+` — TBD; see roadmap.
